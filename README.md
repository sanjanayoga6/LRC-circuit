# LRC-circuit

LRC is an electrical circuit containing an Inductor (L), Resisitor (R) and a Capacitor(C) connected either in series or parallel. These circuits are fundamental in electrical engineering.
Resistor (R): Dissipates energy in the form of heat.
Inductor (L): Stores energy in a magnetic field.
Capacitor (C): Stores energy in an electric field

These are connected with each other with the help of wires and an AC voltage power supply is provided. 
The circuit was built using Circuit Simulator Applet (https://www.falstad.com/circuit/)
The circuit is included as a text file, you can download the text file and import it to the application to run it. 
A 1kΩ resistor, 1H inductor, 10µF capacitor and 40Hz voltage is used.

In a series LRC circuit, the components are connected end-to-end, meaning the same current flows through each component. 
In a parallel RLC circuit, the components are connected across the same voltage source, resulting in different branch currents flowing through each component. 

Applications where LCR is used:
1. Tuning and filtering
2. Resonance
3. Signal processing
